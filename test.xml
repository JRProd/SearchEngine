      <text xml:space="preserve">== Keep it simple ==

Please keep this page clean and simple.  This is the &quot;front page&quot; that has links to other parts of this Wikibook, and should only have major sections listed.  Individual chapters/modules and other parts of this book ought to be listed in the table of contents and as needed in other modules.  

If there are ideas on how to improve this page, please feel free to add comments and suggestions below.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 23:45, 26 May 2007 (UTC)

== Central Discussion ==

If you are making a comment about the general organization of this Wikibook, I would encourage you to use [[Scratch/Planning]] instead of this page for those discussion.  This talk page should be limited to the appearance of this &quot;title page&quot; and any general organization thoughts to help improve this first impression people may have about this book.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 15:21, 27 May 2007 (UTC)</text>
